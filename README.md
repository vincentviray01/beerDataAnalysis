# beerDataAnalysis

Jupyter Notebook for conducting data analysis on the dataset of beer reviews from Beeradvocate. 

Analyzing, exploring and understanding new data sets is a core part of what we do.  In this exercise, weâ€™d like you to analyze an open source dataset of craft beers and answer the following questions:

1. Which brewery produces the strongest beers by ABV%?

2. If you had to pick 3 beers to recommend using only this data, which would you pick?

3. Which of the factors (aroma, taste, appearance, palette) are most important in determining the overall quality of a beer?

4. Lastly, if I typically enjoy a beer due to its aroma and appearance, which beer style should I try?
